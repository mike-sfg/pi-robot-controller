# pi-robot-controller

## Description
This is a collection of Python scripts for controlling a custom-built robot on Raspberry Pi. It allows the robot to be controlled by a wireless PS3 gamepad and also creates a video stream. Since it is robot-specific, it will probably not work for yours without modifications. But feel free to modify it to suit your needs for your own personal projects.
